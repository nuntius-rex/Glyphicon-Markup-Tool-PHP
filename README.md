# Glyphicon-Markup-Tool-PHP
Provides a way to create a shorthand markup tool for Bootstrap Glyphicons for usage in a PHP CMS.

Description: Bootstrap provides a powerful collection of icons available to developers for usage in their sites called Glyphicons. This is great for developers, but what if you wanted to allow a content manager to create them without knowing how to program?

Well, we can do this if we create a way to enter the instruction with a shorthand code, essentially creating your own markup.
Our code works like this: [[name||color|size]]
